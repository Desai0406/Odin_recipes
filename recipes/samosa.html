    <h3><em>Samosas with two different chutney (dips)</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, and peas.</li>
            <li>It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region. Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Medium potatoes 500-550 grams</li>
        <li> Tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li> Teaspoons crushed coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger</li>
        <li>1 green chili chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon hing asafoetida</li>
        <li>1/2 cup +2 tablespoons green peas I used frozen green peas which I soaked in warm water for 10-15 minutes before using</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon amchur dried mango powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red chili powder or add more to taste</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> By making the samosa dough. To a large bowl, add flour, ajwain (carom seeds), salt and mix well.</li>
        <li> Add the oil and then start mixing with your fingers. Rub the flour with the oil until the oil is well incorporated in all of the flour. Do this for 3 to 4 minutes, you don't want to rush this step. Once incorporated,  the mixture resembles crumbs.</li>
        <li> Some flour between your palm- it should form a shape (& not crumble) - means oil is enough and well incorporated.</li>
        <li> Now, start adding water, little by little and mix to form a stiff dough. Don't overwork the dough and don't knead a soft dough. It should just come together and form a stiff dough. I used around 6 tablespoons of water here.</li>
        <li> Cover the dough with a moist cloth and let it rest for 40 minutes. I usually soak a paper towel in water and then squeeze out all the water and then cover my dough with that. While the dough is resting, start working on the filling.</li>
    </ol>
