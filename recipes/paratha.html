    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
        <li>Wheat</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For cooking in a pressure cooker – On a medium flame, cook the potatoes in water for 3 to 4 whistles. When the pressure settles down naturally, remove the lid and drain the water. Allow the potatoes to cool enough to handle and then peel them.</li>
        <li>For cooking in a pan – Cover the pan and cook potatoes in water till fork tender. For this method, it helps to peel the potatoes and chop them in 2 inch cubes before boiling because they will cook faster than whole potatoes. Using a colander, drain all the water and allow the potatoes to cool.</li>
        <li> The potatoes should be mashed very well, with no lumps, chunks or bits. Any lumps in the mix will cause the stuffing to leak out of the dough when rolling.</li>
        <li>Now add the following ingredients, feeling free to vary the spices as you like.
            <ul>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies) or serrano peppers</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon punjabi garam masala powder or Garam Masala Powder</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or cayenne pepper or paprika (optional)</li>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) – or use lemon juice instead
                    salt according to your taste.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
